# Alternate-character
This is a python program that reads in a string and makes each alternate character into an upper case character and each other alternate character a lower case character. e.g. The string “Hello World” would become “HeLlO WoRlD”. Also, the string: “I am learning to code” would become “i AM learning TO code”.
